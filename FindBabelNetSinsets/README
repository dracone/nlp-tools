README - BabelNet API 2.5.1 (November 2014)

This package consists of a Java API to work with BabelNet, a very large
multilingual semantic network. For more information please refer to the
documentation below on how to install and run the software, as well as
our website (http://babelnet.org) and Google group
(http://groups.google.com/group/babelnet-group) for news, updates and
papers.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

We assume that you have a standard installation of the Sun Java 1.6 JDK
and all the associated programs (i.e., java, javac, etc.) in your path.

------------
INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download and configure the BabelNet Lucene indices. The BabelNet API
relies on a set of Lucene indices to access the knowledge base content,
so you need to install them before anything else.

Currently, we provide BabelNet as a semantic network consisting
of 50 languages (English, Catalan, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Afrikaans,
Arabic, Bulgarian, Czech, Welsh, Danish, Greek, Estonian, Persian, Finnish,
Irish, Hebrew, Hindi, Croatian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Icelandic, Japanese,
Korean, Lithuanian, Latvian, Malay, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese,
Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Albanian, Serbian, Swedish, Swahili,
Tagalog, Turkish, Ukranian, Vietnamese, Chinese, Esperanto, Galician, Maltese,
Basque, Latin) and described in the papers below.

The index bundle for BabelNet is available here:

    http://babelnet.org/data/babelnet-2.5.1-index-bundle.tar.bz2

To start using BabelNet, first download the compressed index/indices and
unpack it/them, e.g.:

    # get the data
    wget http://babelnet.org/data/babelnet-2.5.1-index-bundle.tar.bz2
    # unpack the archives
    tar xjvf babelnet-2.5.1-index-bundle.tar.bz2

The BabelNet-2.5.1 directory now contains all the unpacked indices.

Next, tell the API where to find BabelNet by setting the "babelnet.dir"
property in the config/babelnet.var.properties file. For instance,
assuming you unpacked BabelNet in the "/home/your_user/BabelNet-2.5.1",
you simply need to write the following within "config/babelnet.var.properties":

    babelnet.dir=/home/your_user/BabelNet-2.5.1

If your WordNet is not installed in the standard location 
(/usr/local/share/wordnet-3.0), please change the corresponding property
in the config/jlt.var.properties file:

# simply put /usr/local/share/wordnet
jlt.wordnetPrefix=/usr/local/share/wordnet

to the prefix of your WordNet path without the "-3.0" suffix. For instance,
if WordNet 3.0 is located in /opt/WordNet-3.0, you should change the property
to:

jlt.wordnetPrefix=/opt/WordNet

You are now ready to use the API. If you have Apache Ant installed, you
can test that everything works by simply issuing the "ant run-babelnetdemo"
command in the same directory where you found this README file (i.e.,
the root directory of the BabelNet API package). In alternative we also
provide a shell script (run-babelnetdemo.sh, make sure that the file is
executable or set it chmod +x run-babelnetdemo.sh). The next step is to look
at programmatic usage examples starting from the main method of the
"main" API class, namely it.uniroma1.lcl.babelnet.BabelNet.

IMPORTANT: please note that, in order to enable the log4j settings, you
have to add the config folder to your classpath. For instance:

java -classpath bin:lib/*:config it.uniroma1.lcl.babelnet.BabelNetDemo

Within an Eclipse project, right-click the config folder, select
"Build Path" and click "Use as Source Folder".
