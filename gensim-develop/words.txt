chapter id1 resumption of the session speaker id1 namepresident i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday 17 december 1999 and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period p although as you will have seen the dreaded millennium bug failed to materialise still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days during this partsession in the meantime i should like to observe a minute s silence as a number of members have requested on behalf of all the victims concerned particularly those of the terrible storms in the various countries of the european union please rise then for this minute s silence p the house rose and observed a minute s silence  speaker id2 nameevans robert j madam president on a point of order you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in sri lanka one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr kumar ponnambalam who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago would it be appropriate for you madam president to write a letter to the sri lankan president expressing parliaments regret at his and the other violent deaths in sri lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation  speaker id3 namepresident yes mr evans i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate if the house agrees i shall do as mr evans has suggested  speaker id4 namemaccormick madam president on a point of order i would like your advice about rule 143 concerning inadmissibility my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again p the cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability i believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report not a legislative proposal and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday  speaker id5 namepresident that is precisely the time when you may if you wish raise this question ie on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report  speaker id6 languageit namesegni madam president coinciding with this year s first partsession of the european parliament a date has been set unfortunately for next thursday in texas in america for the execution of a young 34 yearold man who has been sentenced to death we shall call him mr hicks p at the request of a french member mr zimeray a petition has already been presented which many people signed including myself however i would ask you in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament and by the whole of the european community to make representations using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent to the president and to the governor of texas mr bush who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person p this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld  speaker id7 namepresident thank you mr segni i shall do so gladly indeed it is quite in keeping with the positions this house has always adopted  speaker id8 languagede nameschroedter madam president i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament has consistently shown an interest it is the case of alexander nikitin all of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in russia too access to environmental information is a constitutional right now however he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing we know and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed including specifically during the last plenary partsession of last year that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for alexander nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings these findings form the basis of the european programmes to protect the barents sea and that is why i would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make parliaments position as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted clear as far as russia is concerned  speaker id9 namepresident yes mrs schroedter i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter  speaker id10 languagenl nameplooijvan gorsel madam president i would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that during this first partsession of the new year the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably but madam president my personal request has not been met although there are now two finnish channels and one portuguese one there is still no dutch channel which is what i had requested because dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well  speaker id11 namepresident mrs plooijvan gorsel i can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the quaestors meeting on wednesday it will i hope be examined in a positive light  speaker id12 namelynne madam president can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 1998 why has there been no fire drill either in the brussels parliament buildings or the strasbourg parliament buildings why are there no fire instructions why have the staircases not been improved since my accident why are nosmoking areas not enforced it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves p  speaker id13 namepresident mrs lynne you are quite right and i shall check whether this has actually not been done i shall also refer the matter to the college of quaestors and i am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on  speaker id14 languagees nameberenguer fuster madam president mrs díez gonzález and i had tabled questions on certain opinions of the vicepresident mrs de palacio which appeared in a spanish newspaper the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous partsession p i would ask that they reconsider since this is not the case the questions answered previously referred to mrs de palacio s intervention on another occasion and not to these comments which appeared in the abc newspaper on 18 november  speaker id15 namepresident mr berenguer fuster we shall check all this i admit that at present the matter seems to be somewhat confused we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be  speaker id16 namemckenna madam president i should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from parliament this week about our discontent over todays decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on indonesia considering that the vast majority in this parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in indonesia in the past todays decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there so parliament should send a message since that is the wish of the vast majority it is irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo as people have said the situation there is extremely volatile there is in fact a risk of a military coup in the future we do not know what is happening so why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people p  speaker id17 namepresident in any event this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday  chapter id2 agenda speaker id18 namepresident the next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 13 january pursuant to rule 110 of the rules of procedure no amendments have been proposed relating to monday and tuesday p relating to wednesday p the group of the party of european socialists requests that a commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the commission p i would like mr barón crespo who made the request to speak to propose it that is if he so wishes of course then we shall follow the usual procedure hearing one speaker in favour and one against  speaker id19 languagees namebarón crespo madam president the presentation of the prodi commission s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the group of the party of european socialists which was unanimously approved by the conference of presidents in september and which was also explicitly accepted by president prodi who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech p this commitment is important because the commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the treaties and therefore basically dictates this parliament s political and legislative activity for the next five years i would also like to point out madam president that this parliament voted to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature it did so again during this legislature in july and then in september it voted once more to approve the whole commission there has therefore been enough time for the commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens to this end i would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 september which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible p the events of last week which originated outside the conference of presidents that conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere present us with a dilemma either the commission is not ready to present this programme in which case it should clarify it according to its president it is in a position to do so given that the commission is represented by vicepresident de palacio i believe that before voting it would help if the commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme as agreed alternatively parliament is not ready to examine this programme as some appear to be suggesting in my opinion this second hypothesis would imply the failure of parliament in its duty as a parliament as well as introducing an original thesis an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware in writing of a speech concerning the commission s programme a week earlier and not a day earlier as had been agreed bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in february so we could forego the debate since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the internet and parliament will no longer have to worry about it p my group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen debate and reflect there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that if the commission is ready to do so we still have time to reestablish the original agreement between parliament and the commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens therefore the proposal of the group of the party of european socialists and which you have mentioned is that the prodi commission present its legislative programme on wednesday including its proposed administrative reform because otherwise we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation on the pretext that there is no text on the one hand the president of the commission would be denied his right to speak in this parliament and on the other hand there would be a debate on a reform when parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based therefore madam president i would ask you to request that the commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote p applause from the pse group  speaker id20 languagede namepoettering madam president i really am quite astonished at mr barón crespo s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on wednesdays agenda p mr barón crespo you were unable to attend the conference of presidents last thursday i am not criticising this it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them mr hänsch represented you on this occasion in the conference of presidents we had an indepth discussion your group was alone in advocating what you are saying now we then put it to a vote as you know each chairman has the same number of votes as his group has members there was a vote on this matter as i recall the outcome of this vote was 422 votes to 180 with a few abstentions this means that all the groups with the exception of the nonattached members but of course they are not a group were in agreement only your group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here all of the others were of a different opinion that was the decision p i should now like to comment on the issue itself we have confidence in the commission and in romano prodi and after a difficult procedure as everyone knows the vast majority of our group supported the vote of confidence in romano prodi and the commission we believe however that the commissions strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the european parliament but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the commission and which describes this programme over the fiveyear period there is no such document p
